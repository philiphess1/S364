    "    - When the loop is over, remember to close the file.\n",
    "- In addition to **from_addresses**, three additional variables have been created for you at the top of the function to store data:  **domains** is a list to store email domains. **number_iupui** stores the number of addresses with 'IUPUI.EDU' as the domain. **number_umich** stores the number of addresses with 'UMICH.EDU' as the domain. \n",
    "- You should have noticed that the domain of an email is the part after the character @ in an email address. Use another for loop to iterate through the list **from_addresses**. Parse out the domain of each email and add it to the list **domains**.\n",
    "- Now you can use methods (functions) of list to get the numbers of domains that are 'IUPUI.EDU' and those that are 'UMICH.EDU'. Save them to **number_iupui** and **number_umich** respectively.\n",
    "- Return **from_addresses**, **domains**, **number_iupui** and **number_umich** in this order (this is already written out for you. Don't delete the code). Now you know the values will be returned as a tuple with 4 elements.\n",
